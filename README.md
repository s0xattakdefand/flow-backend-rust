# 🦀 flow-backend-rust

A production-ready Rust backend architecture that implements the **10 essential stages of a CRUD request lifecycle**, including:

> Routing → Authentication → Authorization → Validation → Business Logic → Data Access → Transformation → Caching → Rate-Limiting → Error Handling

Built using the powerful [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework with a focus on modularity, performance, and developer ergonomics.

## 📦 Features

| Stage              | Technology Used                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Routing**         | Axum Router                         |
| **Authentication**  | JWT (jsonwebtoken crate)            |
| **Authorization**   | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)    |
| **Validation**      | `validator` + Serde                 |
| **Business Logic**  | Clean separation in `logic/`        |
| **Data Access**     | SQLx + PostgreSQL                   |
| **Transformation**  | `From`/`Into` DTO structs           |
| **Caching**         | Redis async (via `redis` crate)     |
| **Rate-Limiting**   | Tower-Governor Middleware           |
| **Error Handling**  | `thiserror` + Axum `IntoResponse`   |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Rust (stable) 🦀
- PostgreSQL (locally or Docker)
- Redis (optional, for caching)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) or `.env` management tool

### 📥 Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flow-backend-rust.git
cd flow-backend-rust
````

### ⚙️ Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file from the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set your PostgreSQL and Redis connection strings.

### ▶️ Run the Server

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will start at: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

---

## 🧪 API Endpoints

Example endpoint:

```
GET /users/hello
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello from user handler"
}
```

More routes for `/users`, `/auth`, `/admin`, etc. will follow full implementation.

## 🐳 Docker Support

Coming soon! A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` will be provided for:

* Redis container
* PostgreSQL container
* Backend service container

---

## 🧠 Why Rust?

* ⚡ High performance (close to C/C++)
* 🛡️ Memory safety guarantees
* 💚 Built-in async support with Tokio
* 🧩 Best suited for microservice APIs

---

## 🔐 Security Practices

* JWTs are validated and signed securely
* Input is validated with `validator`
* Errors are sanitized to avoid leaking internals
* Rate limiting is enforced via middleware

---

## 🧪 Testing & Linting

Run unit tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Format code:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

Lint code:

```bash
cargo clippy
```
